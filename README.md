# Alyssa Forber's Masters Biostatistics Thesis Repo

####This repository contains all work excluding data and code (though code may be added in the future- it is currently on Box) for thesis proposal and paper.

# Project Description

This project is on improving predictive modeling for imbalanced data. The data used are on hospital patients, with the rare outcome of chronic opioid therapy in about 5% of the patients. These data are private. The methods explored for the project include choosing an optimized probability cut-point for predicing the outcome, and using a few different sampling techniques to balance the data. The model used is cross validated lasso.
