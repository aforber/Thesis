## Notes



Doing what we're doing:
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7722/0ef0920c43e6814d471b4f35c75fc97e13c6.pdf




- look up bagging and stepwise selection
- haven't seen much on bagging and down sampling-- look that up, if not that'll be interesting


- check to see if there's a package to do bagging with lasso
- feed final average model with test set
- package SparseLearner? or Predict.bagging
- because when we down sample we only get one subset

- bootstrap aggregate the coefficients and get bootstrap CI (loop through getting new sample, saving coefficients, get mean and sd across 1000 boot samples)


## Simulation

- Simulation of different percentages for rare outcomes
      - which method performs the best for 5% 10% 50%
      - plogis(y, 1, int + b1 x age + b2 x op_receipt + ...)
      - where int <- -1.5 (vary this) b1 <- x (can use estimates from Susan's paper)
      - we get a y (the only thing we need to generate, not the data)
      - then use lasso with y and xmatrix and predict to get confusion matrix 
      - table 3 will be prevelance (5, 20, 50, etc maybe 10 values), and youden vs sampling with the different sens, spec 


show smooth spline of age and probability of COT and show it has a curve to it and why we added the quadratic age
smooth.spline with 3 degrees of freedom
    - Where would it make sense to include this???


accumulate other papers in endnote

(Check out most recent manuscript from paper an citations)


## Notes 11.14.17


look at logistic and lasso results and compare (probably not necessary to include)

See if there are any other ways to choose a threshold

Might want to come up with another methodlogical advancement



Just showed variables for where there is a really big split between outcomes
could use those and then maybe a couple others

mention TRIPOD - mention this, about being transparent, read paper
