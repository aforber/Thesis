## Imbalanced Learning Problem

- Presents a problem of imbalanced data
- Poor sensitivity with rare outcomes
- Need to improve predictive performance



## Aims


- Accurate predicting $\rightarrow$ improving sensitivity and specificity for imbalanced outcome
- Using and comparing methods of probability cut-points and sampling



## Methods

- Create sampled datasets

- Run model on sampled data

- Get predicted probabilities on the test data

- Optimize probability cutoff for outcome

## Model 

- Roughly 2/3 temporal split of data to get train and test set

- Cross validated lasso regression


## Lasso

- Lasso:
    - Shrinks estimates
    - Performs variable selection when shrunk to 0
    
    
$$\hat\beta_{lasso}= argmin \sum_{j=1}^{N}(y_i-\beta_0-\sum_{j=1}^{p}x_{ij}\beta_j)^2 $$

subject to $\sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j| \leq t$ where $t$ is the tuning parameter. 
    
## Cross Validation

- Cross validation: 
    - Find the best "tuning measure" for model selection which determines amount of shrinkage of estimates
    - Split data into k parts and then train on each of those except one you validate against
    - Then pick the tuning measure that minimizes error

## Advantages and Disadvantages


- Advantages:
    - Lower variance of the predicted values
    - More accurate predictions
    - Reduces the number of predictors

- Disadvantages:
    - Biased coefficients, inference not same as logistic regression
    - No standard errors or p-values out of the model



## ROC & Cutoff Probabilities

ROC (with pROC package):

- ROC curve plots sensitivity vs specificity for each cut-off
- Top left corner is ideal
- Youden Index is the furthest upper left corner or "max"

## Confusion Matrix
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.58\textwidth}

\textbf{Correctly identify those w/ outcome:}
$$ Sensitivity = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$

\textbf{Correctly identify those w/o outcome:}
$$ Specificity = \frac{TN}{TN+FP}$$

\textbf{Correctly identify either group:}
$$ Accuracy = \frac{TP+ TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$$

## First approach

No Sampling, Optimize Cut-off:

- Use original unsampled data and get predictions from the lasso model
    - Predictions return probability between 0 and 1 for each observation

- Use 0.5 standard probability cutoff to compare

- Find "best" probability cutoff
      - Youden Index


## Second Approach

Sampling:

- Create sampled data sets that are balanced 
    - Down sample
    - Up sample
    - SMOTE

- Predict and use both standard 0.5 and Youden Index as cutoff

## Down Sampling

- Under-sample majority to equal minority

## Up Sampling

- Over-sample minority to equal majority

## SMOTE

- Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique

## Case Study 1

- Design: Denver Health retrospective analysis electronic health record (EHR) data from 2008 to 2014.

- Patients: Hospitalized patients at an urban, safety-net hospital.

- Definition of Chronic Opioid Therapy (COT) one year following the index hospital discharge:

> Receipt of $\geq$ 90-day supply of opioids with < 30-day gap in supply over a 180-day period or receipt of $\geq$ 10 opioid prescriptions over one year. 



## Case Study 1: Patient Population 

- 27,705 patients
- Majority had incomes <185% of the Federal Poverty Level
- 70% were ethnic minorities
- 5% with COT

- Excluded Patients:
    - <15 or >85 years old
    - Those in prison, jail, or police custody
    - Those who died within one year following their index hospitalization
    - Patients with <2 healthcare visits to Denver Health three years preceding their index hospitalization
    - Undocumented persons receiving emergent hemodialysis
    - Obstetric patients
